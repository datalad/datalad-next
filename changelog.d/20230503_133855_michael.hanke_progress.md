### ðŸ’« Enhancements and new features

- Patch the process entrypoint of DataLad's git-annex special remote
  implementations to funnel internal progress reporting to git-annex
  via standard `PROGRESS` protocol messages. This makes it obsolete
  (in many cases) to implement custom progress reporting, and the
  use of the standard `log_progress()` helper (either directly or
  indirectly) is sufficient to let both a parent DataLad process
  or git-annex see progress reports from special remotes.
