    """Companion to ``iter_gitworktree()`` for git-annex repositories

    This iterator wraps
    :func:`~datalad_next.iter_collections.gitworktree.iter_gitworktree`.
    For each item, it determines whether it is an annexed file. If so,
    it amends the yielded item with information on the respective
    annex key, the byte size of the key, and its (would-be) location
    in the repository's annex.

    The basic semantics of all arguments are identical to
    :func:`~datalad_next.iter_collections.gitworktree.iter_gitworktree`.
    Importantly, with ``fp=True``, an annex object is opened directly,
    if available. If not available, no attempt is made to open the associated
    symlink or pointer file.

    With ``link_target`` and ``fp`` disabled items of
    type :class:`AnnexWorktreeItem` are yielded, otherwise
    :class:`AnnexWorktreeFileSystemItem` instances are yielded. In both cases,
    ``annexkey``, ``annexsize``, and ``annnexobjpath`` properties are provided.

    .. note::
      Although ``annexobjpath`` is always set for annexed content, that does
      not imply that an object at this path actually exists. The latter will
      only be the case if the annexed content is present in the work tree,
      typically as a result of a `datalad get`- or `git annex get`-call.

    Parameters
    ----------
    path: Path
      Path of a directory in a git-annex repository to report on. This
      directory need not be the root directory of the repository, but
      must be part of the repository's work tree.
    untracked: {'all', 'whole-dir', 'no-empty'} or None, optional
      If not ``None``, also reports on untracked work tree content.
      ``all`` reports on any untracked file; ``whole-dir`` yields a single
      report for a directory that is entirely untracked, and not individual
      untracked files in it; ``no-empty-dir`` skips any reports on
      untracked empty directories.
    link_target: bool, optional
      If ``True``, information matching a
      :class:`~datalad_next.iter_collections.utils.FileSystemItem`
      will be included for each yielded item, and the targets of
      any symlinks will be reported, too.
    fp: bool, optional
      If ``True``, information matching a
      :class:`~datalad_next.iter_collections.utils.FileSystemItem`
      will be included for each yielded item, but without a
      link target detection, unless ``link_target`` is given.
      Moreover, each file-type item includes a file-like object
      to access the file's content. This file handle will be closed
      automatically when the next item is yielded.
    recursive: {'repository', 'no'}, optional
      Pass on to
      :func:`~datalad_next.iter_collections.gitworktree.iter_gitworktree`,
      thereby determining which items this iterator will yield.
