    Parameters
    ----------
    path: Path
      Path of a directory in a Git repository to report on. This directory
      need not be the root directory of the repository, but must be part of
      the repository. If the directory is not the root directory of a
      non-bare repository, the iterator is constrained to items underneath
      that directory.
    recursive: {'repository', 'no'}, optional
      Behavior for recursion into subtrees. By default (``repository``),
      all tree within the repository underneath ``path``) are reported,
      but not tree within submodules. If ``no``, only direct children
      are reported on.

    Yields
    ------
    :class:`GitTreeItem`
      The ``name`` attribute of an item is a ``str`` with the corresponding
