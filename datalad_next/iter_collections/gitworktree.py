    """Uses ``git ls-files`` to report on a work tree of a Git repository

    This iterator can be used to report on all tracked, and untracked content
    of a Git repository's work tree. This includes files that have been removed
    from the work tree (deleted), unless their removal has already been staged.

    For any tracked content, yielded items include type information and gitsha
    as last known to Git. This means that such reports reflect the last
    committed or staged content, not the state of a potential unstaged
    modification in the work tree.

    When no reporting of link targets or file-objects are requested, items of
    type :class:`GitWorktreeItem` are yielded, otherwise
    :class:`GitWorktreeFileSystemItem` instances. In both cases, ``gitsha`` and
    ``gittype`` properties are provided. Either of them being ``None``
    indicates untracked work tree content.

    .. note::
      The ``gitsha`` is not equivalent to a SHA1 hash of a file's content,
      but is the SHA-type blob identifier as reported and used by Git.

    Parameters
    ----------
    path: Path
      Path of a directory in a Git repository to report on. This directory
      need not be the root directory of the repository, but must be part of
      the repository's work tree.
    untracked: {'all', 'whole-dir', 'no-empty-dir', 'only', 'only-whole-dir', 'only-no-empty-dir'} or None, optional
      If not ``None``, also reports on untracked work tree content.
      ``all`` reports on any untracked file; ``whole-dir`` yields a single
      report for a directory that is entirely untracked, and not individual
      untracked files in it; ``no-empty-dir`` skips any reports on
      untracked empty directories. The modes starting with 'only' offer the
      same untracked content reporting styles, but only untracked and no
      tracked content is reported. For example, 'only' is the corresponding
      mode to 'all' with no tracked content being reported.
    link_target: bool, optional
      If ``True``, information matching a
      :class:`~datalad_next.iter_collections.utils.FileSystemItem`
      will be included for each yielded item, and the targets of
      any symlinks will be reported, too.
    fp: bool, optional
      If ``True``, information matching a
      :class:`~datalad_next.iter_collections.utils.FileSystemItem`
      will be included for each yielded item, but without a
      link target detection, unless ``link_target`` is given.
      Moreover, each file-type item includes a file-like object
      to access the file's content. This file handle will be closed
      automatically when the next item is yielded.
    recursive: {'submodules', 'repository', 'no'}, optional
      Behavior for recursion into subdirectories of ``path``. By default
      (``repository``), all directories within the repository are reported.
      This possibly includes untracked ones (see ``untracked``), but not
      directories within submodules. With ``submodules``, the full worktree
      is reported on with recursion into submodules. With ``no``,
      only direct children of ``path`` are reported on.
      For any worktree items in subdirectories of ``path`` only a single
      record for the containing immediate subdirectory ``path`` is yielded.
      For example, with 'path/subdir/file1' and 'path/subdir/file2' there
      will only be a single item with ``name='subdir'`` and
      ``type='directory'``.
    pathspecs: optional
      Patterns used to limit results to particular paths. Any pathspecs
      supported by Git can be used and are passed to the underlying ``git
      ls-files`` queries. Pathspecs are also supported for recursive reporting
      on submodules. In such a case, the results match those of individual
      queries with analog pathspecs on the respective submodules (Git itself
      does not support pathspecs for submodule-recursive operations).  For
      example, a ``submodule`` recursion with a pathspec ``*.jpg`` will yield
      reports on all JPG files in all submodules, even though a submodule path
      itself does not match ``*.jpg``.  On the other hand, a pathspec
      ``submoddir/*.jpg`` will only report on JPG files in the submodule at
      ``submoddir/``, but on all JPG files in that submodule.
      As of version 1.5, the pathspec support for submodule recursion is
      preliminary and results should be carefully investigated.

    Yields
    ------
    :class:`GitWorktreeItem` or :class:`GitWorktreeFileSystemItem`
      The ``name`` attribute of an item is a ``PurePath`` instance with
      the corresponding (relative) path, in platform conventions.
