    """Uses ``git ls-files`` to report on a work tree of a Git repository

    This iterator can be used to report on all tracked, and untracked content
    of a Git repository's work tree. This includes files that have been removed
    from the work tree (deleted), unless their removal has already been staged.

    For any tracked content, yielded items include type information and gitsha
    as last known to Git. This means that such reports reflect the last
    committed or staged content, not the state of a potential unstaged
    modification in the work tree.

    When no reporting of link targets or file-objects are requested, items of
    type :class:`GitWorktreeItem` are yielded, otherwise
    :class:`GitWorktreeFileSystemItem` instances. In both cases, ``gitsha`` and
    ``gittype`` properties are provided. Either of them being ``None``
    indicates untracked work tree content.

    .. note::
      The ``gitsha`` is not equivalent to a SHA1 hash of a file's content,
      but is the SHA-type blob identifier as reported and used by Git.

    Parameters
    ----------
    path: Path
      Path of a directory in a Git repository to report on. This directory
      need not be the root directory of the repository, but must be part of
      the repository's work tree.
    untracked: {'all', 'whole-dir', 'no-empty-dir'} or None, optional
      If not ``None``, also reports on untracked work tree content.
      ``all`` reports on any untracked file; ``whole-dir`` yields a single
      report for a directory that is entirely untracked, and not individual
      untracked files in it; ``no-empty-dir`` skips any reports on
      untracked empty directories.
    link_target: bool, optional
      If ``True``, information matching a
      :class:`~datalad_next.iter_collections.utils.FileSystemItem`
      will be included for each yielded item, and the targets of
      any symlinks will be reported, too.
    fp: bool, optional
      If ``True``, information matching a
      :class:`~datalad_next.iter_collections.utils.FileSystemItem`
      will be included for each yielded item, but without a
      link target detection, unless ``link_target`` is given.
      Moreover, each file-type item includes a file-like object
      to access the file's content. This file handle will be closed
      automatically when the next item is yielded.
    recursive: {'repository', 'no'}, optional
      Behavior for recursion into subdirectories of ``path``. By default
      (``repository``), all directories within the repository are reported.
      This possibly includes untracked ones (see ``untracked``), but not
      directories within submodules. If ``no``, only direct children
      of ``path`` are reported on. For any worktree items in subdirectories
      of ``path`` only a single record for the containing immediate
      subdirectory ``path`` is yielded. For example, with
      'path/subdir/file1' and 'path/subdir/file2' there will only be a
      single item with ``name='subdir'`` and ``type='directory'``.

    Yields
    ------
    :class:`GitWorktreeItem` or :class:`GitWorktreeFileSystemItem`
      The ``name`` attribute of an item is a ``PurePath`` instance with
      the corresponding (relative) path, in platform conventions.
