    """Report differences between Git tree-ishes or tracked worktree content

    This function is a wrapper around the Git command ``diff-tree`` and
    ``diff-index``. Therefore most semantics also apply here.

    The main difference with respect to the Git commands are: 1) uniform
    support for non-recursive, single tree reporting (no subtrees); and
    2) support for submodule recursion.

    Notes on 'no' recursion mode

    When comparing to the worktree, ``git diff-index`` always reports on
    subdirectories. For homogeneity with the report on a committed tree,
    a non-recursive mode emulation is implemented. It compresses all reports
    from a direct subdirectory into a single report on that subdirectory.
    The ``gitsha`` of that directory item will always be ``None``. Moreover,
    no type or typechange inspection, or further filesystem queries are
    performed. Therefore, ``prev_gittype`` will always be ``None``, and
    any change other than the addition of the directory will be labeled
    as a ``GitDiffStatus.modification``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    path: Path
      Path of a directory in a Git repository to report on. This directory
      need not be the root directory of the repository, but must be part of
      the repository. If the directory is not the root directory of a
      non-bare repository, the iterator is constrained to items underneath
      that directory.
    from_treeish: str or None
      Git "tree-ish" that defines the comparison reference. If ``None``,
      ``to_treeeish`` must not be ``None`` (see its documentation for
      details).
    to_treeish:
      Git "tree-ish" that defines the comparison target. If ``None``,
      ``from_treeish`` must not be ``None``, and that tree-ish will be
      compared against the worktree. (see its documentation for
      details). If ``from_treeish`` is ``None``, the given tree-ish is
      compared to its immediate parents (see ``git diff-tree`` documentation
      for details).
    recursive: {'repository', 'submodules', 'no'}, optional
      Behavior for recursion into subtrees. By default (``repository``),
      all trees within the repository underneath ``path``) are reported,
      but no tree within submodules. With ``submodules``, recursion includes
      any submodule that is present. If ``no``, only direct children
      are reported on.
    find_renames: int, optional
      If given, this defines the similarity threshold for detecting renames
      (see ``git diff-{index,tree} --find-renames``). By default, no rename
      detection is done and reported items never have the ``rename`` status.
      Instead, a renames would be reported as a deletion and an addition.
    find_copied: int, optional
      If given, this defines the similarity threshold for detecting copies
      (see ``git diff-{index,tree} --find-copies``). By default, no copy
      detection is done and reported items never have the ``copy`` status.
      Instead, a copy would be reported as addition.
      This option always implies the use of the ``--find-copies-harder``
      Git option that enables reporting of copy sources, even when they
      have not been modified in the same change. This is a very expensive
      operation for large projects, so use it with caution.
    yield_tree_items: {'submodules', 'directories', 'all', None}, optional
      Whether to yield an item on type of subtree that will also be recursed
      into. For example, a submodule item, when submodule recursion is
      enabled. When disabled, subtree items (directories, submodules)
      will still be reported whenever there is no recursion into them.
      For example, submodule items are reported when
      ``recursive='repository``, even when ``yield_tree_items=None``.
    eval_submodule_state: {'no', 'commit', 'full'}
      Mode with which submodule changes will be investigated. These modes
      correspond to (some) of the modes offered by the ``--ignore-submodule``
      option of ``git diff-(tree|index)``.
      'no' does not inspect submodules (``--ignore-submodules=all``);
      'commit' ignores all changes to the work tree of submodules
      (``--ignore-submodules=dirty``);
      'full' considers a submodule modified when it either contains untracked
      or modified files or its HEAD differs from the commit recorded in the
      superproject (``--ignore-submodules=none``).
      The treatment of untracked files is determined by the ``untracked``
      parameter.
      When a git-annex repository in adjusted mode is detected,
      the reference commit that the worktree is being compared to, with modes
      ``commit`` and ``full``, is the basis
      of the adjusted branch (i.e., the corresponding branch).


    Yields
    ------
    :class:`GitDiffItem`
      The ``name`` and ``prev_name`` attributes of an item are a ``str`` with
      the corresponding (relative) path, as reported by Git
      (in POSIX conventions).
