"""
*uncurl* git-annex external special remote
==========================================

This implementation is a git-annex accessible interface to datalad-next's URL
operations framework. It serves two main purposes:

1. Combine git-annex's capabilities of registering and accessing file content
   via URLs with DataLad's access credential management and (additional or
   alternative) transport protocol implementations.

2. Minimize the maintenance effort for datasets (primarily) composed from
   content that is remotely accessible via URLs from systems other than
   Datalad or git-annex in the event of an infrastructure transition
   (e.g. moving to a different technical system or a different data
   organization on a storage system).

Requirements
------------

This special remote implementation requires git-annex version 8.20210127 (or
later) to be available.

Download helper
---------------

The simplest way to use this remote is to initialize it without any particular
configuration::

    $ git annex initremote uncurl type=external externaltype=uncurl encryption=none
    initremote uncurl ok
    (recording state in git...)

Once initialized, or later enabled in a clone, ``git-annex addurl`` will check
with the *uncurl* remote whether it can handle a particular URL, and will let
the remote perform the download in case of positive response. By default, the
remote will claim any URLs with a scheme that the local datalad-next
installation supports. This always includes ``file://``, ``http://``, and
``https://``, but is extensible, and a particular installation may also support
``ssh://`` (by default when openssh is installed), or other schemes.

This additional URL support is also available for other commands. Here is an
example how ``datalad addurls`` can be given any uncurl-supported URLs
(here an SSH-URL) directly, provided that the ``uncurl`` remote was initialized
for a dataset (as shown above)::

    $ echo '[{"url":"ssh://my.server.org/home/me/file", "file":"dummy"}]' \\
        | datalad addurls - '{url}' '{file}'

This makes legacy commands (e.g., ``datalad download-url``), unnecessary, and
facilitates the use of more advanced ``datalad addurls`` features (e.g.,
automatic creation of subdatasets) that are not provided by lower-level
commands like ``git annex addurl``.


Download helper with credential management support
--------------------------------------------------

With this setup, download requests now also use DataLad's credential system for
authentication. DataLad will automatically lookup matching credentials, prompt
for manual entry if none are found, and offer to store them securely for later
use after having used them successfully::

    $ git annex addurl http://httpbin.org/basic-auth/myuser/mypassword
    Credential needed for access to http://httpbin.org/basic-auth/myuser/mypassword
    user: myuser
    password: 
    password (repeat): 
    Enter a name to save the credential
    (for accessing http://httpbin.org/basic-auth/myuser/mypassword) securely for future
    reuse, or 'skip' to not save the credential
    name: httpbin-dummy

    addurl http://httpbin.org/basic-auth/myuser/mypassword (from uncurl) (to ...) 
    ok
    (recording state in git...)

By adding files via downloads from URLs in this fashion, datasets can be built
that track information across a range of locations/services, using a possibly
heterogeneous set of access methods.

This feature is very similar to the ``datalad`` special remote implementation
included in the core DataLad package. The difference here is that alternative
implementations of downloaders are employed and the ``datalad-next`` credential
system is used instead of the "providers" mechanism from DataLad's core
package.


Transforming recorded URLs
--------------------------

The main benefit of using *uncurl* is, however, only revealed when the original
snapshot of where data used to be accessible becomes invalid, maybe because
data were moved to a different storage system, or simply a different host.

This would typically require an update of each, now broken, access URL. For
datasets with thousands or even millions of files this can be an expensive
operation. For data portal operators providing a large number of datasets it is
even more tedious.

*uncurl* enables programmatic, on-access URL rewriting. This is similar, in
spirit, to Git's ``url.<base>.insteadOf`` URL modification feature. However,
modification possibilities reach substantially beyond replacing a base URL.

This feature is based on two customizable settings: 1) a *URL template*; and
2) a *set of match expressions* that extract additional identifiers
from any recorded access URL for an annex key.

Here is an example: Let's say a file in a dataset has a recorded access URL
of::

    https://data.example.org/c542/s7612_figure1.pdf

We can let *uncurl* know that ``c542`` is actually an identifier for a
particular collection of items in this data store. Likewise ``s7612`` is an
identifier of a particular item in that collection, and ``figure1.pdf`` is the
name of a component in that collection item. The following Python regular
expression can be used to "decompose" the above URL into these semantic
components::

  (?P<site>https://[^/]+)/(?P<collection>c[^/]+)/(?P<item>s[^/]+)_(?P<component>.*)$

This expression is not the most readable, but it basically chunks the URL
into segments of ``(?P<name>...)``, so-called named groups (see a
`live demo of this expression <https://www.debuggex.com/r/Aa1yua-awXBuqZ39>`__).

This expression, and additional ones like it, can set as a configuration
parameter of an *uncurl* remote setup. Extending the configuration established
by the ``initremote`` call above::

    $ git annex enableremote uncurl \\
        'match=(?P<site>https://[^/]+)/(?P<collection>c[^/]+)/(?P<item>s[^/]+)_(?P<component>.*)$'

The last argument is quoted to prevent it from being processed by the shell.

With the match expression configured, URL rewriting can be enabled by declaring
a URL template as another configuration item. The URL template uses the `Python
Format String Syntax
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-string-syntax>`__. If the
new URL for the file above is now
``http://newsite.net/ex-archive/c542_s7612_figure1.pdf``, we can declare
the following URL template to have *uncurl* go to the new site::

    http://newsite.net/ex-archive/{collection}_{item}_{component}

This template references the identifiers of the named groups we defined in the
match expression. Again, the URL template can be set via ``git annex
enableremote``::

    $ git annex enableremote uncurl \\
        'url=http://newsite.net/ex-archive/{collection}_{item}_{component}'

There is no need to separate the ``enableremote`` calls. Both configuration can
be given at the same time. In fact, they can also be given to ``initremote``
immediately.

The three identifiers ``site``, ``collection``, ``item``, and ``component`` are
actually a custom addition to a standard set of identifiers that are available
for composing URLs via a template.

- ``datalad_dsid`` - the DataLad dataset ID (UUID)
- ``annex_dirhash`` - "mixed" variant of the two level hash for a particular key
  (uses POSIX directory separators, and included a trailing separator)
- ``annex_dirhash_lower`` - "lower case" variant of the two level hash for a
  particular key (uses POSIX directory separators, and included a trailing
  separator)
- ``annex_key`` - git-annex key name for a request
- ``annex_remoteuuid`` - UUID of the special remote (location) used by git-annex
- ``git_remotename`` - Name of the Git remote for the uncurl special remote

.. note::
   The URL template must "resolve" to a complete and valid URL. This cannot
   be verified at configuration time, because even the URL scheme could be a
   dynamic setting.

Uploading content
-----------------

The *uncurl* special remote can upload file content or store annex keys
via supported URL schemes whenever a URL template is defined. At minimum,
storing at ``file://`` and ``ssh://`` URLs are supported. But other URL
scheme handlers with upload support may be available at a local DataLad
installation.


Deleting content
----------------

As for uploading, deleting content is only permitted with a configured
URL template. Moreover, it also depends on the delete operation being
supported for a particular URL scheme.


Configuration overrides
-----------------------

Both match expressions and the URL template can also be configured in a dataset's
configuration (committed branch configuration, or any Git configuration scope
(local, global, system) using the following configuration item names:

- ``remote.<remotename>.uncurl-url``
- ``remote.<remotename>.uncurl-match``

where ``<remotename>`` is the name of the special remote in the dataset.

A URL template provided via configuration *overrides* one defined in the special
remote setup via ``init/enableremote``.

Match expressions defined as configuration items *extend* the set of match
expressions that may be included in the special remote setup via
``init/enableremote``. The ``remote.<remotename>.uncurl-match`` configuration
item can be set as often as necessary (which one match expression each).

Tips
----

When multiple match expressions are defined, it is recommended to use unique
names for each match-group to avoid collisions.
