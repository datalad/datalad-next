    # This context starts a thread that populates the subprocess's standard input. It
    # also starts a threads that reads the process's standard error. Otherwise we risk
    # a deadlock - there is no output because the process is waiting for more input.
    #
    # This itself introduces its own complications and risks, but hopefully mitigated
    # by having a well defined start and stop mechanism that also avoid sending data
    # to the process if it's not running
    #
    # To start, i.e. on entry to the context from client code
    # - The process is started
    # - The thread to read from standard error is started
    # - The thread to populate input is started
    #
    # When running:
    # - The standard input thread iterates over the input, passing chunks to the process
    # - While the standard error thread fetches the error output
    # - And while this thread iterates over the processe's output from client code
    #   in the context
    #
    # To stop, i.e. on exit of the context from client code
    # - This thread closes the process's standard output
    # - Wait for the standard input thread to exit
    # - Wait for the standard error thread to exit
    # - Wait for the process to exit
    #
    # By using context managers internally, this also gives quite strong guarantees that
    # the above order is enforced to make sure the thread doesn't send data to the process
    # whose standard input is closed and so we don't get BrokenPipe errors

    # Writing to the process can result in a BrokenPipeError. If this then results in
    # a non-zero code from the process, the process's standard error probably has useful
    # information on the cause of this. However, the non-zero error code happens after
    # BrokenPipeError, so propagating "what happens first" isn't helpful in this case.
    # So, we re-raise BrokenPipeError as _BrokenPipeError so we can catch it after the
    # process ends to then allow us to branch on its error code:
    # - if it's non-zero raise an IterableSubprocessError containing its standard error
    # - if it's zero, re-raise the original BrokenPipeError
