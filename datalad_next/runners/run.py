    """ A context manager for subprocesses

    The run-context manager will start a subprocess via ``ThreadedRunner``,
    provide the result of the subprocess invocation, i.e. the result of
    ``ThreadedRunner.run()`` in the ``as``-variable, and
    clean up the subprocess when the context is left.

    The run-context manager supports the guaranteed exit of a subprocess through
    either:

     a) natural exit of the subprocess
     b) termination of the subprocess via SIGTERM, if ``terminate_time`` is
        specified
     c) termination of the subprocess via SIGKILL, if ``kill_time`` is specified

    If the process terminates the run-context manager will ensure that its exit
    status is read, in order to prevent zombie processes.

    If neither ``terminate_time`` nor ``kill_time`` are specified, and the
    subprocess does not exit by itself, for example, because it waits for some
    input, the ``__exit__``-method of the run-context manager will never return.
    In other words the thread will seem to "hang" when leaving the run-context.
    The only way to ensure that the context is eventually left is to provide a
    ``kill_time``. It is a good idea to provide a ``terminate_time`` in
    addition, to allow the subprocess a graceful exit (see ``kill_time``- and
    ``terminate_time``-argument descriptions below).

    Generator- and non-generator-protocols are both supported by the
    context manager. Depending on the type of the provided protocol the
    interpretation of ``terminate_time`` and ``kill_time`` are different.

    If a non-generator-protocol is used, counting of the ``terminate_time`` and
    the ``kill_time`` starts when the subprocess is started.

    If a generator-protocol is used, counting of the ``terminate_time`` and
    the ``kill_time`` starts when the run-context is left.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cmd : list[str]
        The command list that is passed to ``ThreadedRunner.run()``
    protocol_class : type[Protocol]
        The protocol class that should be used to process subprocess events.
    cwd: Path, optional
        If provided, defines the current work directory for the subprocess
    stdin: int | IO | bytes | Queue[bytes | None], optional
        Input source or data for stdin of the subprocess. See the constructor
        of :class:`ThreadedRunner` for a detailed description
    timeout: float, optional
        If provided, defines the time after which the timeout-callback of the
        protocol will be enabled. See the constructor
        of :class:`ThreadedRunner` for a detailed description
    closing_action: Callable, optional
        This argument is only used in generator-mode.

        If given, should be a callable that takes two arguments. The first
        argument will be the :class:`ThreadedRunner`-instance that executes the
        subprocess. The second argument will be the result generator, that was
        returned by :meth:`ThreadedRunner.run`.

        The context
        manager will call this function when the context is left. Because the
        code executed in the context can be left unexpectedly there might be
        actions that a user wants to perform in order to instruct the subprocess
        to terminate. For example, if the subprocess is a git-annex command in
        batch-mode, the user might want to close stdin of the subprocess. When
        the ``closing_action`` returns, the run-context-manager will be "armed",
        that means terminate- and kill-time counting begins.
    terminate_time: int, optional
        The number of timeouts after which a terminate-signal will be sent to
        the process, if it is still running. If no timeouts were provided in the
        ``timeout``-argument, the timeout is set to ``1.0``.
    kill_time: int, optional
        If ``terminate_time`` is given, a kill-signal will be sent to the
        subprocess after kill-signal after ``terminate_time + kill_time``
        timeouts. If ``terminate_time`` is not set, a kill-signal will be sent
        after ``kill_time`` timeouts.
        It is a good idea to set ``kill_time`` and ``terminate_time`` in order
        to let the process exit gracefully, if it is capable to do so.
    protocol_kwargs : dict
        A dictionary with Keyword arguments that will be used when
        instantiating the protocol class.

    Yields
    -------
    Any | Generator
        The result of the invocation of :meth:`ThreadedRunner.run` is returned.
