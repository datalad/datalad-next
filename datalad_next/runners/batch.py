"""Helpers to execute batch commands

    """Generic context manager for batch processes

    ``cmd`` is an ``argv``-list specification of a command. It is executed via
    a :class:`~datalad_next.runners.run.run` context manager. This context
    manager is parameterized with ``protocol_class`` (which can take any
    implementation of a DataLad runner protocol), and optional keyword arguments
    that are passed to the protocol class.

    On leaving the context, the manager will perform a "closing_action". By
    default, this is to close ``stdin`` of the underlying process. This will
    typically cause the underlying process to exit. A caller can specify an
    alternative function, i.e. ``closing_action``. If ``closing_action`` is set,
    the function will be called with two arguments. The first argument is the
    :class:`BatchProcess`-instance, the second argument is the stdin-queue of
    the subprocess.
    A custom ``closing_action`` might, for example, send some kind of exit
    command to the subprocess, and then close stdin. This method exists because
    the control flow might enter the exit-handler through different mechanisms.
    One mechanism would be an un-caught exception.

    If ``terminate_time`` is given, the context handler will send a
    terminate-signal to the process, if it is still running ``terminate_time``
    seconds after the context is left. If ``kill_time`` is given, the context
    handler will send a kill-signal to the process, if it is still running
    ``(terminate_time or 0) + kill_time`` seconds after the context is left.

    If neither ``terminate_time`` nor ``kill_time`` are set and the process
    is not triggered to exit, e.g. because its stdin is not closed or because
    it requires different actions to trigger its exit, batchcommand will wait
    forever after the context exited. Note that the context might also be
    exited in an unexpected way by an ``Ãˆxception``.

    While this generic context manager can be used directly, it can be
    more convenient to use any of the more specialized implementations
    that employ a specific protocol (e.g., :func:`stdout_batchcommand`,
    :func:`annexjson_batchcommand`).

    Parameters
    ----------
    cmd : list[str]
        A list containing the command and its arguments (argv-like).
    cwd : Path | None
        If not ``None``, determines a new working directory for the command.
    closing_action: Callable | None
        If not ``None``, contains a callable that will be called when the context
        is left. The callable is invoked with two arguments, the
        :class:`BatchProcessor`-instance and the stdin-queue.
        if ``closing_action`` is ``None``, :func:`batchcommand`will close stdin
        of the subprocess by calling the method :meth:`BatchProcess.close_stdin`.
    terminate_time: int | None
        The number of timeouts after which a terminate-signal will be sent to
        the process, if it is still running. If no timeouts were provided in the
        ``timeout``-argument, the timeout is set to ``1.0``.
    kill_time: int | None
        See documentation of :func:`datalad_next.runners.run.run`.
    protocol_kwargs: dict
        If ``terminate_time`` is given, a kill-signal will be sent to the
        subprocess after kill-signal after ``terminate_time + kill_time``
        timeouts. If ``terminate_time`` is not set, a kill-signal will be sent
        after ``kill_time`` timeouts.
        It is a good idea to set ``kill_time`` and ``terminate_time`` in order
        to let the process exit gracefully, if it is capable to do so.
