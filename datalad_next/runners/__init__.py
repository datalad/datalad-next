"""Execution of subprocesses

This module provides all relevant components for subprocess execution.  The
main work horse is :func:`~datalad_next.runners.iter_subproc`, a context
manager that enables interaction with a subprocess in the form of an iterable
for input/output processing. Execution errors are communicated with the
:class:`~datalad_next.runners.CommandError` exception. In addition, a few
convenience functions are provided to execute Git commands (including
git-annex).

.. currentmodule:: datalad_next.runners
.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated

   iter_subproc
   call_git
   call_git_lines
   call_git_oneline
   call_git_success
   iter_git_subproc
   CommandError


Low-level tooling from datalad-core
-----------------------------------

.. deprecated:: 1.4
   The functionality described here has been deprecated, and the associated
   imports from datalad-core are scheduled for removal with version 2.0.
   Use the implementations listed above instead.

Few process execution/management utilities are provided, for
generic command execution, and for execution command in the context
of a Git repository.

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated

   GitRunner
   Runner

Additional information on the design of the subprocess execution tooling
is available from https://docs.datalad.org/design/threaded_runner.html

A standard exception type is used to communicate any process termination
with a non-zero exit code

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: generated

   CommandError

Command output can be processed via "protocol" implementations that are
inspired by ``asyncio.SubprocessProtocol``.
