    semantics of a dataset parameter to a receiving command.

    A corresponding `Dataset` instance is provided via the `ds` property.

class EnsureDataset(Constraint):
    """Ensure an absent/present `Dataset` from any path or Dataset instance

    Regardless of the nature of the input (`Dataset` instance or local path)
    a resulting instance (if it can be created) is optionally tested for
    absence or presence on the local file system.

    Due to the particular nature of the `Dataset` class (the same instance
    is used for a unique path), this constraint returns a `DatasetParameter`
    rather than a `Dataset` directly. Consuming commands can discover
    the original parameter value via its `original` property, and access a
    `Dataset` instance via its `ds` property.

    In addition to any value representing an explicit path, this constraint
    also recognizes the special value `None`. This instructs the implementation
    to find a dataset that contains the process working directory (PWD).
    Such a dataset need not have its root at PWD, but could be located in
    any parent directory too. If no such dataset can be found, PWD is used
    directly. Tests for ``installed`` are performed in the same way as with
    an explicit dataset location argument. If `None` is given and
    ``installed=True``, but no dataset is found, an exception is raised
    (this is the behavior of the ``required_dataset()`` function in
    the DataLad core package). With ``installed=False`` no exception is
    raised and a dataset instances matching PWD is returned.

        purpose: str, optional
