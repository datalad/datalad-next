"""Make push avoid refspec handling for special remote push targets

This change introduces a replacement for core's ``push.py:_push()``
with a more intelligible flow. It replaces the stalled
https://github.com/datalad/datalad/pull/6666

Importantly, it makes one behavior change, which is desirable IMHO.
Instead of rejecting to git-push any refspec for a repo with a detached
HEAD, it will attempt to push a git-annex branch for an AnnexRepo. The
respective test that ensured this behavior beyond the particular
conditions the original problem occurred in was adjusted accordingly.

All ``push`` tests from core are imported and executed to ensure
proper functioning.

Summary of the original commits patching the core implementation.

- Consolidate publication dependency handling in one place
- Consolidate tracking of git-push-dryrun exec
  Make a failed attempt discriminable from no prior attempt.
- Factor out helper to determine refspecs-to-push for a target
- Consolidate more handling of git-pushed and make conditional on an
  actual git-remote target
  This change is breaking behavior, because previously a source repository
  without an active branch would have been rejected for a push attempt.
  However, this is a bit questionable, because the git-annex branch
  might well need a push.
- Simplify push-logic: no need for a fetch, if there is no git-push
- Factor out helper to sync a remote annex-branch
- Adjust test to constrain the evaluated conditions (replacement
  tests is included here)
  As per the reasoning recorded in datalad#1811 (comment)
  the test ensuring the continue fix of datalad#1811 is actually
  verifying a situation that is not fully desirable. It prevents
  pushing of thew 'git-annex' branch whenever a repo is on a detached
  HEAD.
  This change let's the test run on a plain Git repo, where there is
  indeed nothing to push in this case.
